  - Project assignment to students
  - Submission of project reports by the students(supervisees)
  - Approve or decline of students’ reports by the supervisor

### Diabetes prediction using Machine Learning Techniques(https://github.com/Chi-Claudette/Diabetes-prediction-using-ml)  (https://github.com/Chi-Claudette/diabetes-prediction-UI)
- **Description:** Build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the early risk of developing diabetes based on various diabetes risk factors. And provides a user-friendly inteterface where individuals can input relevant data to check their diabetes risk status and take actions as soon as posible.
  We applied six different machine learning classification algorithms and choose the best model in prediction diabetes, based on the performance of each model on the different evaluation metrics.
  The technologies and tools used are; python, flask, jupyter notebook, diabetes dataset from kaggle, python libraries(like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and so on), machine learning classification algorithms(knn, logistic regression, svm, random forest, MLP, and GBM)
- **Key Features:**
  - Data aquisition
  - Data preprocessing
  - Algorithm selection
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning
  - Model evaluation
  - Model integration into a flask web application

### Note-taken Application (https://github.com/Chi-Claudette/Note-taken-app-in-angular)  (https://github.com/Chi-Claudette/Note-taken-app-in-springboot)
- **Description:** Creates and manages notes. The technologies and frameworks used are; angular, springboot and mysql.
- **Key Features:**
  - Create note
  - Update/Modify note
  - Delete note
